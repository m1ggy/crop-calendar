# Rice

Rice (_Oryza sativa_) is a staple food for more than half of the world's population, particularly in Asia. It is a member of the grass family, Gramineae, and is cultivated for its edible seeds, which are commonly known as rice grains.

# Procedures

## Planting

1. **Choose Planting Time:**

   - Plant rice when soil temperatures are consistently above 70°F (21°C).

2. **Soil Preparation:**

   - Choose a sunny location with fertile, clayey soil that can hold water.
   - Level the field and prepare the soil by plowing and harrowing.

3. **Seed Preparation:**

   - Soak rice seeds in water for 24-48 hours before planting to encourage germination.

4. **Transplanting (for paddy rice):**

   - Transplant seedlings into flooded fields when they are 25-35 days old.

5. **Direct Seeding (for upland rice):**

   - Broadcast rice seeds onto prepared soil and cover lightly with soil.

6. **Water Management:**
   - Maintain flooded conditions in paddy fields throughout the growing season.
   - Keep upland fields moist but not waterlogged.

## Growing

1. **Fertilization:**

   - Apply organic or chemical fertilizers based on soil test results and rice growth stage.

2. **Weed Control:**

   - Regularly remove weeds by hand or use herbicides as necessary.

3. **Pest and Disease Management:**

   - Monitor for pests such as rice blast and insects like rice stem borers.
   - Apply appropriate pesticides or biological control measures.

4. **Rice Growth Stages:**
   - Rice typically goes through stages such as germination, tillering, flowering, grain filling, and maturity.

## Harvesting

- **Timing:** Harvest rice when grains have turned golden yellow and have a moisture content of about 20%.
- **Method:** Cut rice stalks close to the ground and thresh to separate grains from the straw.
