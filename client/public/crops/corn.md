# Procedures

## Planting

1. **Choose Planting Time:**

   - Plant corn when soil temperatures reach 60°F (15.5°C) or higher.

2. **Soil Preparation:**

   - Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil.
   - Loosen soil to a depth of 8-10 inches (20-25cm) and remove weeds.

3. **Sowing Seeds:**

   - Plant corn seeds 1-2 inches (2.5-5cm) deep and 9-12 inches (23-30cm) apart.
   - Plant in blocks instead of single rows to ensure good pollination.

4. **Watering:**

   - Keep soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, especially during the first few weeks after planting.

5. **Fertilizing:**
   - Apply a balanced fertilizer when planting and side-dress with nitrogen when corn plants are knee-high.

## Growing

1. **Maintenance:**

   - Keep the area around corn plants weed-free to reduce competition for nutrients and water.
   - Hill soil around the base of the plants when they are about 12 inches (30cm) tall to support root development.

2. **Pollination:**

   - Corn plants have both male (tassels) and female (silks) flowers. Wind pollinates the corn by carrying pollen from tassels to silks.

3. **Pest and Disease Control:**
   - Monitor for pests such as corn earworm and control them with appropriate measures.
   - Watch for diseases like corn smut and treat as necessary.

## Harvesting

- **Timing:** Harvest corn when kernels are plump and produce a milky liquid when pierced with a fingernail.
- **Method:** To harvest, twist ears downward and pull them from the stalk.
